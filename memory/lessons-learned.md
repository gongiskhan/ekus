# Lessons Learned

*Hard-won knowledge from real-world usage. Read this to avoid repeating mistakes.*

## Software Development

### Always Use Agent Teams for Complex Tasks
Never try to do complex dev work inline. For anything beyond trivial edits:
1. Break the task into roles (lead, implementer, tester)
2. The coordinator does NO coding — only plans and delegates
3. A tester agent is ALWAYS required
4. The tester uses `agent-browser` to verify visually
5. Only declare success after tester confirms with screenshots

### Always Verify Work in Browser
After any UI/frontend change, verify it works visually:
- `agent-browser` CLI is preferred
- Chrome extension is fallback
- Never assume code changes work without visual verification

### agent-browser CLI Patterns
```bash
agent-browser open <url>        # Navigate
agent-browser snapshot -i       # Get interactive elements with refs
agent-browser click @e1         # Click element
agent-browser fill @e2 "text"   # Fill input
agent-browser screenshot        # Take screenshot proof
agent-browser close             # Close
```

### Template Literal Gotchas
Avoid `</script>` and triple backticks inside template literals in HTML files.
The browser parser gets confused. Use string concatenation or escape sequences.

### Roadmap/Config Changes = Commit + Push Immediately
When asked for changes to roadmaps, configs, or docs — always commit and push right away.

## Email

### himalaya > gog CLI
The `himalaya` CLI works reliably for Gmail (search, read, attachments).
The `gog` CLI hangs and crashes (SIGKILL). Use himalaya as primary.

### himalaya Search Syntax
```bash
himalaya envelope list --page-size 50 "subject fatura or subject recibo"
himalaya envelope list "from vodafone"
himalaya message read <ID>
```
- Use `or` (lowercase) not `OR`
- Max ~3 conditions per search (IMAP limitation)
- Search in INBOX by default, use `--folder` for others

## Invoice Collection (Faturas)

Recurring monthly task. Sources:
- **Gmail**: Vodafone, Credibom, Via Verde, Prio, BCP
- **WhatsApp**: Uber Eats receipts
- **Portals**: InvoiceXpress, Atlantic Summit (need browser automation)
- **Download strategy**: Search email → download attachments → organize by month
- **Upload to accountant portal** (Octa Manager): Use direct API, not browser upload

## Browser Automation

### Cookie Banners First
Always dismiss cookie/consent banners before interacting with a page.

### Login Flows
Fill one field at a time. Verify each step. Take screenshots at key moments.

### Bot Detection
Some portals (banking, government) have aggressive bot detection.
For these, use real Chrome (Claude for Chrome extension) not headless browsers.

## Trello API

### URL-encode Portuguese Characters
Always use `--data-urlencode "name=..."` for card names with accents.

### Archiving = Done
Done tasks get `closed=true` (archived), never deleted.

### Sync Pattern
1. Fetch all cards from list
2. Compare with local task list (match by title)
3. Create missing cards, archive done ones
4. Never create duplicates — always check first

## Scheduling & Reminders

### Triple-Action Reminders (ADHD Support)
For any reminder, use ALL available channels:
1. Calendar event (exact time)
2. Trello card (with due date)
3. Local file entry

This ensures nothing gets missed even if one system is ignored.

### Cron Expression Cheat Sheet
```
* * * * *
│ │ │ │ │
│ │ │ │ └─ Day of week (1-7, Mon=1)
│ │ │ └─── Month (1-12)
│ │ └───── Day of month (1-31)
│ └─────── Hour (0-23)
└───────── Minute (0-59)

Examples:
0 8 * * 1-5     = 8am weekdays
0 6-21 * * 1-5  = Every hour 6am-9pm weekdays
*/30 * * * *    = Every 30 minutes
0 9 25 2 *      = Feb 25 at 9am (one-shot)
```

## Image Generation

### Gemini > DALL-E for Logos
Gemini Nano Banana Pro is better for precise logos. Always specify:
- Pure white background (#FFFFFF) — no true transparency
- Exact colors with hex codes
- PNG format

## Voice / TTS

### ElevenLabs Pipeline
1. Generate speech via API (`eleven_multilingual_v2` for Portuguese)
2. Speed up 1.5x: `ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -filter:a "atempo=1.5" -y output.mp3`
3. Send the sped-up file

### Keep Text Under 5000 chars per TTS request
